# ParaProvider Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `ParaProvider` component in a React application. The `ParaProvider` component
is used to provide the necessary context and configuration for the application. Using the `ParaProvider` component
streamlines the number of props that need to be passed down to child components, making the code cleaner and easier to
maintain.
