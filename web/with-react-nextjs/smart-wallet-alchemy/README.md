# Smart Wallet Demo with Para and Alchemy

This is a Next.js application that demonstrates smart wallet (Account Abstraction) functionality using Para SDK and
Alchemy's Account Kit. Users can create and manage ERC-4337 smart wallets, send and receive ETH, and enjoy gasless
transactions through Alchemy's gas sponsorship.

## Features

- üîê Connect with external wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase, Rainbow, etc.) or email/phone
- üè¶ Create up to 3 smart wallets per EOA (Externally Owned Account)
- üí∏ Send and receive ETH with gasless transactions
- üìä Real-time balance tracking with USD conversion
- üé® QR code generation for receiving assets
- üõ°Ô∏è Secure authentication with route protection

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and Yarn
- Para API key from [Para Dashboard](https://developer.getpara.com)
- Alchemy API key and Gas Policy ID from [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com)
- WalletConnect Project ID (optional, for WalletConnect support)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Para Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARA_API_KEY=your_para_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARA_ENVIRONMENT=DEV # or PROD

# Alchemy Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your_alchemy_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_GAS_POLICY_ID=your_gas_policy_id

# Optional: WalletConnect
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run the development server
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Users connect their EOA wallet using Para's modal (supports multiple wallet providers)
2. **Create Smart Wallet**: Once connected, users can create smart wallets that are controlled by their EOA
3. **Manage Assets**: View balances, send ETH to other addresses, and receive assets via QR code
4. **Gasless Transactions**: All smart wallet transactions are sponsored by Alchemy's gas manager
