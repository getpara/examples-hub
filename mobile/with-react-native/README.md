# React Native Para SDK Example

This example demonstrates how to integrate Para SDK in a React Native application with authentication and wallet management.

## Prerequisites

- React Native development environment ([setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup))
- Para API key from [developer.getpara.com](https://developer.getpara.com/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
PARA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Install iOS dependencies:
```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Running the App

### Android
```bash
yarn android
# or
npm run android
```

Android works out of the box using the debug.keystore that all React Native apps use by default. This keystore is already registered with Para.

### iOS

**Important:** The iOS app is configured with Para's team ID and will not run locally without modification.

To run on iOS with your own team:

1. Update `app.json` with your own bundle identifier and team ID
2. Register your new bundle identifier in the Para Developer Portal under API Key Settings â†’ Configuration
3. Wait up to 24 hours for Apple and Google to update associated domains
4. Then run:
```bash
yarn ios
# or
npm run ios
```

Without these steps, iOS will fail due to security restrictions on passkey authentication.

## Features

- **Multiple Authentication Methods:**
  - Email with OTP verification
  - Phone with SMS verification
  - OAuth (Google, Discord)
  - Passkey authentication

- **Wallet Management:**
  - Create and retrieve EVM wallets
  - Sign messages

## Key Configuration

- **Polyfills:** Configured in `metro.config.js` for crypto operations
- **App Scheme:** `para-sdk-demo://` for OAuth redirects
- **Environment:** Beta environment configured in `src/para.ts`
