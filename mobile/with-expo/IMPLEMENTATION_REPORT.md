# Para SDK Expo Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the discrepancies between the Para SDK documentation and the actual implementation requirements for creating a working Expo demo application.

## Key Discrepancies and Corrections

### 1. Environment Variables
**Documentation Issue**: The documentation doesn't clearly explain how to handle API keys in Expo projects.

**Correction Made**: 
- Created `.env.local` file for storing the API key
- Used `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables (required by Expo)
- Added proper environment variable loading in `src/para.js`
- Added `.env.local` to `.gitignore` for security

### 2. Prebuild Requirement
**Documentation Issue**: The documentation mentions prebuild but doesn't emphasize strongly enough that it's REQUIRED for native modules to work. It's easy to miss that `expo start` (Expo Go) won't work.

**Correction Made**:
- Must run `npx expo prebuild` before attempting to run the app
- Must use `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android` instead of `expo start`
- Expo Go cannot be used due to native module requirements

### 3. Package Name Configuration
**Documentation Issue**: The documentation shows `FF9U73RS48.com.getpara.example` as the package name, but this includes the team ID which should be configured separately.

**Correction Made**:
- Set `bundleIdentifier` and `package` to `com.getpara.example`
- Added separate `appleTeamId` field in iOS configuration with value `FF9U73RS48`

### 4. Module Import Path
**Documentation Issue**: The documentation references importing from `@getpara/react-native-wallet` but doesn't specify the exact shim import path.

**Correction Made**:
- The shim must be imported as `@getpara/react-native-wallet/dist/shim` (with `/dist/shim` suffix)
- This import must be the very first line in `index.js`

### 5. API Methods and Authentication Flow
**Documentation Issue**: The documentation provides examples but doesn't clearly show the complete authentication flow handling.

**Correction Made**:
- Implemented proper stage checking (`verify` vs `login`) in authentication flow
- Added error handling for all Para SDK methods
- Created clear separation between new user signup and existing user login

### 6. Missing UI Components
**Documentation Issue**: The documentation doesn't provide guidance on UI implementation for mobile.

**Correction Made**:
- Created custom native React Native components for all UI elements
- Implemented proper loading states and error displays
- Added tab navigation for different authentication methods

## Recommendations for Documentation Improvements

1. **Emphasize Native Module Requirements**
   - Add a prominent warning that Expo Go cannot be used
   - Clearly state that prebuild is REQUIRED, not optional
   - Provide troubleshooting for common prebuild issues

2. **Environment Variable Setup**
   - Add a dedicated section for Expo environment variable configuration
   - Explain the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix requirement
   - Provide `.env.local` example file

3. **Complete Code Examples**
   - Include full authentication flow examples with error handling
   - Show complete component implementations
   - Provide a working demo repository link

4. **Platform-Specific Configuration**
   - Clarify the difference between package name and team ID
   - Show correct `app.json` configuration for both platforms
   - Add more details about SHA-256 certificate requirements for Android

5. **Build and Run Instructions**
   - Create a step-by-step guide specifically for Expo projects
   - Include common build errors and solutions
   - Add performance optimization tips for development builds

## Summary

The Para SDK integration with Expo is functional but requires several corrections from the documentation. The main challenges were:
1. Understanding that native modules require development builds (not Expo Go)
2. Proper environment variable configuration
3. Correct package name and team ID setup
4. Complete authentication flow implementation

With these corrections, the demo app successfully demonstrates all Para SDK features including email/phone authentication, wallet creation, and transaction signing.
